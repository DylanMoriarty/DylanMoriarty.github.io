<p>One of my hobbies is to take images my graphic design buddies post on Facebook and jokingly spruce them up. I offer some awful advice, and provide visual guides to further illustrate how they can *improve* their designs. 
<p>All initial designs are by Cameron Jackson. Edits by myself and through the magic of Google Image Search, Shutterstock & Photoshop.
<p>Hover over the images to see my modifications.
  
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/1.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/2.jpg'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/1.jpg'"></img></div>



<p>Not to shabby, but it lacked what really makes a fitness center mean something: people working out! An empty weight room does nothing for our imaginations if we can’t see the results up front!
    <div class= "words-linebreak"></div>
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/3.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/4.jpg'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/3.jpg'"></img></div>

  <p>I dug this design- though felt the name of the event was getting lost in the center hole. With a minor tweak, the eye will be more drawn to it, resulting in a more unified graphic.
    <div class= "words-linebreak"></div>

<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/14.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/5.png'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/14.jpg'"></img></div>

  <p>Adobe gets a lot of flak for the widespread abuse of their filters, but I find a lot get underutilized. Consider using such neglected ones such as the Buschemi Fill, which adds just the right amount of Steve Buschemi head to your design.
    <div class= "words-linebreak"></div>

<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/6.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/7.png'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/6.jpg'"></img></div>

  <p>When making an infographic, you really want to draw the viewers eye in with something that makes them feel good so they’ll stick around and really soak in all those hard facts. Replacing all your graphics with cats is a pretty slick method in the business to accomplish this.
  <p>Also, while you may have personally collected or researched those facts, but unless you have a celebrity endorsement, it’s likely people will just write it off as propaganda. Use a well-known and well-liked celebrity to help endorse your facts to the common man.
    <div class= "words-linebreak"></div>

<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/8.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/9.jpg'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/8.jpg'"></img></div>

  <p>This is good. Don’t be ashamed to claim credit for putting together good work. You may be doing work for the client, but don’t miss opportunities to let people know who’s actually responsible for such a sensible arrangement of data.
    <div class= "words-linebreak"></div>

<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/tgd/10.jpg"
  onmouseover="this.src='./img/tgd/11.png'"
  onmouseout="this.src='./img/tgd/10.jpg'"></img></div>

  <p>Getting people to volunteer for anything is a noble, but painful endeavor. You really got make the thing look spicy hot! What better way than to make it look like a spicy hot party?

<p>By adding color, attractive people, and some *pizzazz*, what was just another call out for volunteers becomes the hit must-go-to event of the semester!  

<p>Also starbursts. The more starbursts you can fit on the page, the more attractive it will be. Same goes for typefaces.
