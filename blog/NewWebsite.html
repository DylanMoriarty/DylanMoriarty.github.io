<p>Howdy folks,
<p>For the last four months or so, I've had an itch to update my personal website. I'm proud of the previous incarnation, but it was still more or less derivative of my very first website. Over time problems accumlated, and so I've rebuilt it from scratch. Here's a few of the issues I'd had, how (and why) I've fixed them, and of course, credit where credits due.

<img src="./img/npw/1-SplashScreen.png"></img>
On both my first and previous websites, I had this fun little map as the first thing you saw.
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/npw/OlderFront.png" 
    onmouseover="this.src='./img/npw/OldFront.png'"
    onmouseout="this.src='./img/npw/OlderFront.png'"></img></div>
<p>The initial page, while cool, was unnecessary. For a portfolio site the impressive projects should float to the top over any pizzazz.
<p>I realized that almost all of my favorite websites had a more "news" orientated front page. Whatever they did, when you went to the home-page, you'd see the most recent work.
<p>The design I went with is entirely derivative of the father of D3, <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock's page</a>. I'd done something similar on my Tumblr, but the brevity of his front page was really nice.
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/npw/tublr.png"></img></div>
<p>A few other notable inspirations were <a href="http://tabletopwhale.com/">Tabletop Whale</a>, <a href="http://stamen.com/">Stamen Design</a> and <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>.
<img src="./img/npw/2-MultipleWeb.png"></img>
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/npw/Navbar.png"></img></div>
<p>Of the six items listed in my previous navigation bar, three of them took you off of the site.
<p>That's not good! Having my contact info or link back to other works on every single page seems essiential to a portfolio. After a bit of consideration, I boiled down this all down to four tabs. My music ventures and other hobbies now regulated to my About/Contact page. Love ya <a href="http://www.gallantghosts.com/">Gallant Ghosts</a>, but you're not essiential to my professional job prospects.
<p>In general website creep is also just fairly stressful. Having a facebook, tumblr, twitter, linkedin, google+, personal website, comic, and so on just becomes to much to deal with on a regular basis. The result ends up being most of those fading into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web">deep web</a>. By conslidating most of that, updating turns into a one stop shop.
<img src="./img/npw/3-Folder.png"></img>
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/npw/toomayhtml.png"></img></div>
<p>Which is to say, I understand relative paths now, so there is a folder structure now. This makes organizing pages and just overall management significantly better.
<div class="bimg"><img src="./img/npw/justright.png"></img></div>
<img src="./img/npw/4-Responsive.png"></img>
<p>This is the crowning achievement of this new iteration. Responsive design simply means that the site will adapt to whatever screen size you might be viewing it with. In the modern world where there's absolutely no standard for screen sizes, this is essiential.
<p>To make a site responsive, you basically have to assign every element of the page a placement/size based off a % of the total page width, or % distance from other objects. There's a multitude of tools out there to make this easier, but after a bit of research I decided that this site was simple enough that I could just do it myself... and I was right!
<p>It's certainly not perfect, but the site retains most of it's form. You can check it out for yourself by messing around with your browser window.

<img src="./img/npw/5-Proto.png"></img>
<p>Over the course of a couple of nights I put together a prototype design for the website, which I kept pretty close to in the final version.
<img src="./img/npw/proto1.png"></img>
<img src="./img/npw/proto2.png"></img>
<img src="./img/npw/proto3.png"></img>
<img src="./img/npw/proto4.png"></img>
<p>It should be noted that even these Prototypes are the result of great feedback from a few of my friends, including <a href="http://tolomaps.com/">Robin Tolochko</a>, <a href="http://kkowalsky.github.io/">Katie Kowalsky</a>, & <a href="www.garrickjannene.com">Garrick Jannene.</a>
<p>Have any feedback? Critiques? I'd love to hear it. <a href="../about.html">Contact me!</a>
<p>Cheers.
