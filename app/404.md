<div class="center">Aw shucks. The link you went to doesn't exist. Bummer.</div>

If you were brought here by a link on the site itself, it'd be amazing if you could [file an issue here to let me know](https://github.com/DylanMoriarty/dylanmoriarty.github.io/issues/new)!

Otherwise to make up for the lack of content, have some tunes-

<div id = "musicbox">
  <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aeatincake%3Aplaylist%3A6ISbZ3sIhNG5JzCofpDfPb" width="100%" height="300px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
</div>
<br>

-and good luck finding what you were looking for!
