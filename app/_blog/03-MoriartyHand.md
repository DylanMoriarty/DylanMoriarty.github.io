(This post is a WIP.)

Over a few days this past summer I took to drawing the world. Or, well, linework of it.

Almost all Cartographers like their data percise and accurate- and therefore almost everyone uses the same georeferenced linework as a base for their maps. Project Linework is a resource created and curated by <span class="tooltip">Daniel Huffman<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Daniel is a freelance Cartographer, lecturer, and all around smart guy. He runs a <a href="https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com" target="_blank">pretty great blog</a> that details his work.</span></span> that seeks to alleviate this monotomy by providing styled lineworks that abstract boundaries in creative ways.


Afterall, not all maps need such percision! As Huffman puts it:

"[Project Linework is a] library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each designed in a unique aesthetic style. They are meant to break us away from default line paths that we so often rely on by providing more visually-interesting alternatives."

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}I
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Charmingly Inaccurate
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

We wanted to make a linework that looked hand drawn, but not inaccruate to the point of it being useless. 

So, after a few test runs, we determined the best way to get a nice balance was to trace accurate data from Natural Earth Data at certain points and then free-hand the geography between those traced sections.

So, for Flordia I marked where the tip was, where it bent to, and then drew the rest by eyeballing it. This put things in roughly the right area with enough flourishes and errors for it to truly look manmade.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}II
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Extra Layers
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Because it didn't take terribly long to do the initial drawing, we also went ahead and rivers. For this the method was similar (albeit without as many traced points), but it was drawn on a different sheet of paper over the country boundaries.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Cleaning Up
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Once I was done, Daniel scanned the drawings. We then combed over the scans and corrected all breaks in the lines, noted missing boundaries, and made sure the lines weren't too fat.

The cleaned file was then run through Illustrator Trace to convert it into vector linework. Yeah!

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}IV
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Adding the Data
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

Daniel took over this stage, thankfully for me. 

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}V
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Finished Linework
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

And with that, we have a sketchy georeferenced artwork that folks can use for their maps! We can project it, as well as layer other georeferenced data on top of it. Enjoy!

Cheers!
