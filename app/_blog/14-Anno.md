I like having a website, but worry that the 'highlight reel' nature of it doesn't offer a decent space to just post some of the smaller things I do on a day to day basis. Since around Christmas I thought it'd be a neat to create a space for that in the form of a reverse calendar.

<div class="images"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/anno/"><img src="../assets/graphics/blog/ann/annoover.png" class="ib"><figcaption>Check it out!</figcaption></a></div>

Halfway through the year, I finally got around to building it!

Now you too can see the brief forays into Mapbox Studio and post it note doodles I do on a daily basis. Oh boy! The project lives on [dylanmoriarty.github.io/anno/]({{ site.baseurl }}/anno).

{% include bits/chapters.html chapter='I' title='Anno?'%}

Anno is Latin for "In the Year Of", which is exactly what this is: Dylan in the year of 2016.

In truth I wanted to name this something better than just "Calendar", and found this term pretty quick Googling around. I hope it doesn't come off as pretentious! Anno was a nice, concise, interesting, and spot on term for it.

{% include bits/chapters.html chapter='II' title="...it's just a Facebook Album"%}

Kinda. I didn't realize how similar it was until things started working. Oh well. I can customize this a heckuva lot more and the project has served as good practice for web development. I'm content that people might 'like' something without hitting a button to show it.

Enjoy!
