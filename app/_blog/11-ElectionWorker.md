Government websites aren't the <span class="tooltip">best things.<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Unless they're <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>. Those guys do great stuff.</span></span>

They contain invaluable resources for how to get involved with government, but lack the uniformity and densly packed navigation makes accessing those resources difficult. It feels like working through a virtual filing cabinet where the folder labels are only vague suggestions of what they might contain.

One such resource is how you can work election polls. <a href="https://www.workelections.com/#/">WorkElections</a> is a tool DevelopmentSeed built with the Fair Elections Network & Election Academy to make it easier for folks to find that out! 

Through the site you can enter your state, county, city, zip code or address and be taken to details on what the requirements are to work a polling station and direct links to where you can sign up to get started! 

The database is manually updated by FELN, and is grabbable by an <span class="tooltip">API<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">You can <a href="https://api.workelections.com/">check out the API here.</a></span></span>. As it's manually updated, there's <span class="tooltip">only a handful<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa"></i><span class="tooltiptext">AZ, CA, FL, NV, NM, OH, VA</span></span> of states currently covered. More are to be added down the line.
