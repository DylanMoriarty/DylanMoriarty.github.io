Howdy folks,

Over the last few months I've joined the Development Seed team and moved out to Washington DC! Here's a quick overview of what that's entailed, & a few odds and end projects that I finished up on before the big move.

{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Moriarty Hand
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

I drew up the world for Daniel Huffman's Project Linework. 

"A library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each designed in a unique aesthetic style. They are meant to break us away from default line paths that we so often rely on by providing more visually-interesting alternatives."

{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Victory Lap Icons 
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}OSM Analytics 
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


{% include bits/chapter1.html %}IV
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}New Webzone 
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


{% include bits/chapter1.html %}V
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}I'm on Google Maps! 
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}


This is the first project I worked on with DevSeed that was publically released. Basically,

For those interested in the data, the choropleth is based off of which states have > 500 jobs in the logging industry.

{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Cereal Tours Map
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

A major project I've been building of late is a framework for [agresource](http://agresource.com/). Basically, they're running all over the Midwest taking pictures of farmers crops, and wanted to have an interactive map which the users can both check out where the farms are and the pictures as the season progresses.

This project was a lot of fun, and a great way to work on some hefty manipulation of Leaflet icons.

It hasn't been published yet, we're waiting on a few more adjustments, but look forward to a process post when it does. Here's a working version of what the framework looks like. The images are all placeholders, as that's something AgResource will be providing.

<div class = "block"></div>

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}III
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Cat Map
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

As a follow-up to the work I'd been doing with AgResource, I was curious seeing how far I could push icons drawn with Leaflet. Essentially, I wanted to test 1. How many icons could be drawn on a screen before the user would start to get a significant amount of lag? and 2. Can those icons just be drawings as opposed to svg circles?

Decided to test both things (and GeoJson manipulation within the script) with this goofy thing- Click a Cat, Get a Cat.

{% include bits/chapter1.html %}IV
{% include bits/chapter2.html %}Wheels
{% include bits/chapter3.html %}

<div class="images"><img src="/graphics/blog/smr/Wheels.png"></div>

My band Gallant Ghosts finally released our EP! It was a lot of work, but the good kind. Listen and enjoy while also enjoying a couple more posters I'd drawn up for some of our shows.
