Here's a map of all the basketweavers in the world;

<div class="images">
	{% include svgs/bwo/basketweavers.svg %}
</div>

Or, well, that's all of the basketmakers in the world... according to OpenStreetMap.

Which seems off, right? It's reasonable to assume there's at least one Aussie out there crafting baskets. Obviously this means OpenStreetMap is an unreliable data source.

Yet thousands of applications rely on data from it! From Uber navigating millions around dense cities, to Doctors without Borders deciding where to allocate resources, to etc etc etc

Why are so many organizations using a source that's clearly flawed?

{% include bits/chapters.html chapter='I' title='OpenStreetWat'%}

Well, for many places in the world, it's surprisingly complete where it counts. For example,when it comes to road networks it has some of the best publically avaiabile data. 

<div class= "full-bleed">
	<div id="map-roads"></div>
</div>

While a lot of that data does exist in the coffers of government websites, OpenStreetMap provides it *all* in one place and _relatively_ up to date to boot.

When it comes to buildings, it's also not too shabby for many cities.

	<div id="map-buildings"></div>

Generally speaking, Europe is the best mapped area in the world. This is largely due to Britian being the birthplace of the whole project, and a large group of blah blah blah

{% include bits/chapters.html chapter='II' title='The Missing Bits'%}

There's a reason when you see 3d maps it's almost _always_ San Fran or New York. They're incredibly well mapped out and have data inside for everything from water fountains to building heights!

Other parts of the world that lack the volume of people are significantly less represented. If your hometown is under 20,000 people, chance is good large sections of your town haven't been mapped out. Even where there's a polygon for the buildling we can still see disparity of coverage looking at city malls,

The best thing about OpenStreetMap though? It's a {% include bits/tooltips.html face="Wiki-esque" longtext="I take pride that I made it this far without calling OSM a Wiki version of Google Maps" %}. database that anyone can edit!

There are a few people out there who get paid to contribute and maintain the quality of OpenStreetMap, but not quite enough to map everything. Have some time to spare?
