	<p class = "center">Howdy!</p>

	<p>I'm a cartographer, illustrator, and front end web developer who's currently cranking out graphics for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal.</a></p>

	<p>I also am a member of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. Previously I worked at <a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank">Development Seed</a> building open tools for great organizations, helped organize MaptimeDC, co-ran a small get together called GeobreakfastDC, and continue to be inspired by all the amazing people I worked there with.</p>
