<div class="cake-intro">
<p>This is a collection of comics I did Madison's <a href="http://host.madison.com/daily-cardinal/">The Daily Cardinal</a> circa my tenure as a Graphics Editor between 10'-13' and on rare occasions afterwards. In 2013, Eatin' Cake lost in a National competition for College Newspaper comics to a comic about the weather. C'est la vie. Manger le g√¢teau.
<p>Enjoy!
